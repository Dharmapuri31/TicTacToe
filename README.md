# TicTacToe
<body> 
  The game is done using Minimax search. It is a backtracking algorithm that is used for decision making in game theory. 
  
  
  The first player plays x and the second player plays o. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
  
  vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all cells are used without someone getting a three in a row, the game is a draw.
