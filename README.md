  <h2>
  Tic Tac Toe:
  </h2>
  
  The first player plays x and the second player plays o. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
  
  vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all cells are used without someone getting a three in a row, the game is a draw.
  
  <u>Points to keep in mind</u>: 
  <br>1) If both players play optimally, the game will always be a draw.</br>
  <br>2) If one player is optimal and the other is random, the optimal player will win most of the games and the random player will never win. </br>
